### Introduction

<img src = "https://manoa-market-place.github.io/doc/Landing-Page.png">

The Manoa Marketplace is an application for UHM students to facilitate buying and selling of student-related goods and services.
I collaborated with four teammates: Andrew Lin, Yujie He, Baishen Wang, and Carlton Hung. 
Manoa Marketplace incorporates various technologies to enhance its functionality. The implementation of client and server code is facilitated through Meteor, which utilizes Javascript. The user interface is crafted using Bootstrap 5 React, ensuring a modern and responsive design. Additionally, form development is streamlined with the utilization of Uniforms, contributing to an efficient and user-friendly experience.

### Experience


In this project, my primary focus involved the development of functionalities within the administrator account and the shopping cart system. Within the administrator account, I implemented features to streamline administrative tasks and enhance overall management. Additionally, I played a crucial role in designing and refining the shopping cart, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopping experience for users.


Furthermore, I took charge of creating the "My Product Page" feature, a personalized space for students to manage their listed products. This page empowers students to effortlessly display all the products they own, providing options to edit or delete items as needed. The aim was to offer students a user-friendly platform that not only showcases their possessions but also enables them to have complete control over the content on their "My Product Page."
