Everyone has their own way of learning, and some may enjoy having new WODs every day, while for others, the constant change can be stressful. They may prefer a structured or traditional exercise routine. The key is to find a learning style and exercise program that works for you. I enjoy the challenge and variety of WOD.

<pre>
  function blackjack(x,y){
	function value(hand) {
    return hand.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  }
  let xValue = value(x);
  let yValue = value(y);
  if(xValue > 21){
  	return "I Lost."
  } else if(yValue> 21){
  	return "I Won!."
  } else if(xValue > yValue ){
  	return "I Won!."
  }
  	return "I Lost."
  
}
	
console.log(blackjack([10, 5, 10], [10, 7])); // Prints "I lost." to the console.
console.log(blackjack([7, 8, 6], [6, 10, 10])); // Prints "I won!" to the console.
console.log(blackjack([7, 8, 3], [6, 5, 4])); // Prints "I won!" to the console.
console.log(blackjack([7, 8, 3], [6, 5, 9])); // Prints "I lost." to the console.
console.log(blackjack([10, 10], [5, 10, 5])); // Prints "I lost." to the console

This is my first WOD and it took over 6 minutes.This made me realize that my technique was decline or not performing as expected. Participating in WOD and similar training is a challenge. This training method can help me exercise my coding skills and make me flexibility, and also improve my self-confidence. Overall, practicing WOD has worked for me, but needs to be done in the right environment and with the right guidance to ensure maximum benefit.
